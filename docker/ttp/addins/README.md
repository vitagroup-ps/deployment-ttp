### Sense and Purpose ###
Additional files can be stored in this directory, which can be loaded and processed by the deployments directly from the file system. The directory refers to `/entrypoint-wildfly-addins` in the WildFly image and can be found by the deployments via `${jboss.server.data.dir}/addins/`.
