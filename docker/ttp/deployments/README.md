### Sense and Purpose ###
This directory is exclusively for deployments, such as `.ear` or `.war` files. When the WildFly deploys, it creates files with the extension `.isdeploying` and/or `.deployed`, so this directory should have read-write access.<br>
Since the introduction of the ENV variable "`WILDFLY_MARKERFILES=auto`", write access is now only optional. Only when the value is set to `true` does write access become mandatory. Only in this case must the directory owner be adjusted as follows:

```bash
sudo chown 1111:1111 deployments
```
